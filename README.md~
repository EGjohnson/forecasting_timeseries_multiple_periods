## What the script does

the script will execute the following steps:

* 1. Read in data 
* 2. Inspect Data
* 3. Characterize relationship/processes linking two data sets
* 4. Decompose timeseries and account for any remaining structured noise
* 5. Forecast timeseries
* 6. Adjust for changes in user behavior (Daylight Savings Time)
* 7. Construct A probable average_response_time timecourse for the projection
* 8. Account for the impact of the simulated response time slowdown events in the forecasted projection of throughput
* 9  create 4 week forecasted data frame in same format as original
